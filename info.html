                follows:-
                1. Short title, extent and commencement.

            <li class="name">Right to free legal aid
            <p>The government passed this law in accordance with Article 39-A of the Indian Constitution to offer free legal aid to anyone who cannot afford to hire an attorney.</p>
        </li>
            <li class="name">Right against the cheque bounce
            <p>According to Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881, bouncing a check is an infraction that is subject to a fine of up to double the amount of the cheque, up to two years in prison, or both.</p>
        </li>
            <li class="name">Right under the Maternity Benefit Act
            <p>A pregnant woman cannot be fired by a corporation, according to the Maternity Benefit Act of 1961. A maximum of three years in prison could be used as punishment. Employees in the public and private sectors are subject to this rule. </p>
        </li>
            <li class="name">Right to take legal action if a police officer snatches your vehicle’s keys
            <p>According to the Motor Vehicle Act of 1988, you have the right to file a lawsuit against a traffic police officer who grabs your automobile or motorcycle's key.</p>
        </li>
            <li class="name">Rights of a woman when arrested
            <p>No woman may be taken into custody before sunrise or after sunset (After 6 pm and before 6 am), with the exception of extraordinary circumstances, according to section 46 of the criminal procedure code (CrPc). Additionally, a male police officer is never allowed to arrest a woman.</p>
        </li>
            <li class="name">Right to Equal pay for Equal work
            <p>Equal pay for equally hard labour is required by the Equal Remuneration Act of 1976, a piece of legislation. They should receive equal compensation if two or more people performed the same task in similar situations.</p>
        </li>
            <li class="name">Right of parents to be maintained by their children
            <p>Parents (father or mother, whether biological, adoptive, or stepfather or stepmother, whether senior citizen or not) have the right to demand support from their adult children under Section 125 of the Cr. P.C.</p>
        </li>
            <li class="name">Right to claim a Refund
            <p>Every consumer is entitled to a full refund under the terms of the Consumer Protection Act of 1986 if they are dissatisfied with their purchase or are unable to use the services they have paid for.

                In truth, printing "No exchange or refund" on bills and invoices is against the law and constitutes an unfair business conduct.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="name">Right to File an FIR
            <p>A police officer is not permitted to decline to file a FIR, as stated in Indian Penal Code 166 A. A police officer who declines to submit a FIR for a cognizable violation is subject to punishment under Section 166A(c) of the Indian Penal Code if they are an Indian citizen. 

                The police officer in these situations "will be responsible for prosecution and punishment," according to the Supreme Court. How should I use this right?
                
                Visit the police station (preferably close to the crime scene) and provide the officer in charge of that area all the information you have. Additionally, Section 154 of the CrPC offers the informant the option of providing information verbally or in writing.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="name">Right to Life
            <p>According to Article 21, no one, not even the government, has the right to take your life. Under passing laws to protect you, the government is required by this law to take the necessary steps to protect life. 

                In addition, the right to life requires the government to protect you if your life is in danger by taking the necessary measures.
                
                When making decisions that could put you in risk or have an impact on your life expectancy, public authorities should also take into account your right to life.
                
                You can be entitled to an investigation if a family member passes away due to state involvement.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="name">Right to Education
           <p>Every child between the ages of 6 and 14 has the fundamental right to access an education, and RTE establishes minimum standards for primary institutions.

According to this rule, all private schools must reserve 25 percent of their seats for students (to be reimbursed by the state as part of the public-private partnership plan).

Additionally, it forbids any unrecognised schools from operating, and it stipulates that there will be no donation or capitation fees, as well as no parent or child interviews for admittance.

The Act also states that until the end of elementary school, no kid shall be held back, expelled, or compelled to pass a board exam.</p>
</li> 
            <li class="name">Right to Equality
            <p>The Indian Constitution's Right to Equality (Article 14) guarantees equality before the law within Indian territory. Anyone and everyone who is on Indian soil, including corporations and foreigners as well as citizens of India, is subject to this law.

                Classification is allowed under Article 14 as long as it is "reasonable," but class legislation is not allowed. It is appropriate to classify people into groups when:
                
                The classification is based on discernible differences that separate the grouped individuals or things from those who are not included in the group.
                The disparity makes sense in connection to the act's goal.</p>
